## [Scrum Theory](#scrum-theory)

### [Scrum](#scrum)

* Founded on *empiricism*

* Comprised of
    - [Scrum Teams](#scrum-team)
    - [Roles](#scrum-roles)
    - Rules
    - [Events](#scrum-events)
    - [Artifacts](#scrum-artifacts)

* Pillars that uphold [Scrum](#scrum)
    - Transparency
    - Inspection
    - Adaption

* Opportunities to Inspect and Adapt
    - [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)
    - [Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum)
    - [Sprint Review](#sprint-review)
    - [Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)

* Burn-down Charts show how much work remains till the end of the [Sprint](#sprint).

* Cone of Uncertainty shows how much is known about the Product over time

* Each component within the [Scrum](#scrum) framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to [Scrum](#scrum)'s success and usage.

* [Scrum](#scrum) is not a process or a technique for building products. It is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. It does not describe agile processes and techniques.

* If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

* If an organization has decided to adopt [Scrum](#scrum) but management wants to change the terminology
    - Management may feel less anxious, however
    - Without a new vocabulary as a reminder of the change, very little change may actually happen, and
    - The organization may not understand what has changed with [Scrum](#scrum) and the benefits of [Scrum](#scrum) may be lost

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### [Sprint](#sprint)

* The length of a [Sprint](#sprint) should be
    - No more than one month
    - Short enough to keep the business risk acceptable by the [Product Owner](#product-owner)
    - Short enough to be able to synchronize the development work with other business events

* [Scrum](#scrum) does not require having aligned [Sprints](#sprint) for multiple teams.

* Can be cancelled by *only* the [Product Owner](#product-owner)
    - Any completed and [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) Items are reviewed
    - If part of the work is releasable the [Product Owner](#product-owner) accepts it
    - Incomplete [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) Items are re-estimated and put back on the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog)
    - The [Sprint](#sprint) is cancelled only if the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal) becomes obsolete

* During the [Sprint](#sprint)
    - No changes are made that would endanger the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal)
    - Quality goals do not decrease
    - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the [Product Owner](#product-owner) and [Development Team](#development-team) as more is learned

* During the _first_ [Sprint](#sprint), the [Development Team](#development-team)
    - Delivers an increment of releasable software
    - Develops and delivers at least one piece of functionality

* [Development Teams](#development-team) deliver an [Increment](#increment) of Product functionality every [Sprint](#sprint)
    - This [Increment](#increment) is usable so a [Product Owner](#product-owner) may choose to immediately release it
    - Each [Increment](#increment) only contains "Done" functionality that could be released immediately
    - It is not normal to have a "hardening" [Sprint](#sprint) to remove technical debt and prepare the Product for upcoming release

* The [Sprint](#sprint) is over when the time-box expires.

* The next [Sprint](#sprint) begins immediately after the conclusion of the previous [Sprint](#sprint).

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal)

* Provides guidance to the [Development Team](#development-team) on why it is building the [Increment](#increment).

* The [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal) is an objective set for the [Sprint](#sprint) that can be met through the implementation of [Product Backlog](#product-backlog).

* After the [Development Team](#development-team) forecasts the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) items it will deliver in the [Sprint](#sprint), the [Scrum Team](#scrum-team) crafts a [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal).

* If the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal) becomes obsolete the [Sprint](#sprint) may be cancelled.

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## [Scrum Artifacts](#scrum-artifacts)

* [Scrum](#scrum) users must frequently inspect [Scrum Artifacts](#scrum-artifacts) and progress toward a [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal) to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog)

* The [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) items selected for this [Sprint](#sprint) plus the plan for delivering them.

* Created at the [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning).

* Belongs solely to the [Development Team](#development-team)
    - [Development Team](#development-team) members are never exclusive owners of a [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) Item
    - All [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) Items are owned by the entire [Development Team](#development-team), even though each one may be done by an individual [Development Team](#development-team) member

* The [Development Team](#development-team) modifies the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) throughout the [Sprint](#sprint)
    - The [Development Team](#development-team) may learn more about the work needed to achieve the [Sprint Goal](#sprint-goal)
    - As new work is required the [Development Team](#development-team) adds it to the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog)
    - Only the [Development Team](#development-team) may change the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog)

* If an item in the [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) cannot be finished by the end of the [Sprint](#sprint) it should be renegotiated between the [Product Owner](#product-owner) and [Development Team](#development-team).
    - The [Sprint](#sprint) is not cancelled in this case

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### [Product Backlog](#product-backlog)

* Is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product

    - The [Product Owner](#product-owner) can delegate some work related to [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) management to the [Development Team](#development-team)
    - The [Product Owner](#product-owner) is responsible for the content, availability and ordering of the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog)

* [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) refinement consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the [Development Team](#development-team).

* Features of a [Product Backlog](#product-backlog)
    - Never complete
    - Evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves
    - Dynamic — constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful
    - As long as a product exists, its [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) also exists

* [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) management includes
    - Clearly expressing [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) items
    - Ordering the items in the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) to best achieve goals and missions
    - Optimizing the value of the work the [Development Team](#development-team) performs

    - Ensuring the [Development Team](#development-team) understands items in the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) to the level needed

[▲ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### [Increment](#increment)

* The [Increment](#increment) is the sum of all the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) Items completed during the [Sprint](#sprint) *and* the value of the increments of all previous [Sprints](#sprint).

* Only members of the [Development Team](#development-team) create the [Increment](#increment).
